# Covert-Valorant-Esp-Aimbot-Hack
Covert Valorant Esp Aimbot Source Code Hack

### Info Setup
**Tested on Windows 10 x64 also Windows 11.** You have to copy the Roboto-Light.ttf file from the second Covert folder into your execution directory for imgui to use this font
It should compile without changing anything, but you have to implement your own memory r/w mechanic to work, also the offsets are probably outdated as this cheat will very likely not receive any updates, and you have to implement a guarded regions bypass.

#### ðŸŸ¢ THIS HACK IS UNDETECTED.
